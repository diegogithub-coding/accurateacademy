        You can see a <a href="https://diegogithub-coding.github.io/accurateacademy/EnglishGrammar/B1B2/11_Conditionals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full explanation&nbsp;</a>of type 0, type 1, type 2 and type 3 conditional with examples.<br>
        &nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Mixed conditionals</h2>
        <p>We use mixed conditionals if we want to mix talking about the present and the past in the same sentence. The mixed conditional is a combination of the <a href="https://test-english.com/grammar-points/b1-b2/second-third-conditionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second and the third conditional</a>:</p>
        <p>➪ We can use past simple or continuous in the <strong2>if</strong2>-clause&nbsp;(to refer to the present or future), and <strong2>would</strong2>/<strong2>should</strong2>/<strong2>might</strong2> <strong2>have</strong2> + <strong2>past participle</strong2> in the main clause (to refer to the past).</p>
        <p>➪ We can also use past perfect in the <strong2>if</strong2>-clause (to refer to the past), and&nbsp;<strong2>would</strong2>/<strong2>should</strong2>/<strong2>might</strong2> + <strong2>infinitive</strong2>&nbsp;(to refer to the present).</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>didn’t have</strong2></span></em>&nbsp;(second conditional)<em> so much work, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>would have gone</strong2></span></em> (third conditional)<em> to the party last night. </em></li>
        <li><em>If I <strong2><span style="color: #ec6825;">spoke</span>&nbsp;</strong2></em>(second conditional)<em> German, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>would have understood</strong2></span></em> (third conditional)<em> them. </em></li>
        <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>had won</strong2></span></em> (third conditional)<em> the lottery, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>would be</strong2></span></em>&nbsp;(second conditional)<em> rich. </em></li>
        <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>hadn’t dropped</strong2> </span></em>(third conditional)<em> school, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>could have</strong2></span>&nbsp;</em>(second conditional)<em> a better job now.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Alternatives to <strong2>if</strong2> in conditional sentences</h2>
        <h4>As long as / provided (that) / providing (that) / on condition (that) / only if</h4>
        <p>We can use the expressions <strong2>as long as, provided/providing (that), on condition (that),</strong2>&nbsp;or <strong2>only if&nbsp;</strong2>instead of&nbsp;<strong2>if&nbsp;</strong2>when we want to emphasize the condition that needs to be present so that&nbsp;something can&nbsp;happen or be done.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>I’ll tell you what really happened <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>as long as</strong2></span> you keep the secret.</em></li>
        <li><em>I’ll lend you the money <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>provided&nbsp;(that) </strong2></span>you pay me back next month. </em></li>
        <li><em>They will speak to the press <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>on condition&nbsp;(that)</strong2></span> they remain anonymous sources. </em></li>
        <li><em>We will&nbsp;invest the money, but <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>only if</strong2> </span>you can prove that it’s a safe investment.&nbsp;</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Whether or not</h4>
        <p>We use <strong2>whether or not</strong2> when there are two alternatives and we want to say that something will happen or will be true in any of those two alternatives. Compare:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>I’ll help him <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>if</strong2></span> he needs me.</em> (=I will help him only if he&nbsp;needs me.)</li>
        <li><em>I’ll help him <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>whether or not</strong2></span> he needs me.</em> (I will help him if he needs me, and I will help him if he doesn’t need me, too.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Even if</h4>
        <p>We also use&nbsp;<strong2>even if</strong2>&nbsp;with a similar meaning to ‘whether or not’. It is used to emphasize that something will still be true or will happen if another thing happens.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Even if</strong2></span> you apologise, he’ll never forgive you.</em> (=Whether or not you apologise, he’ll never forgive you.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Suppose/supposing</h4>
        <p>We normally use&nbsp;<strong2>suppose&nbsp;</strong2>or&nbsp;<strong2>supposing</strong2> at the beginning of a sentence to make someone imagine a situation. It means ‘what would happen if’, or simply ‘if’ (imagining a situation).</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Supposing</strong2></span> I got&nbsp;a job, I wouldn’t be able&nbsp;to travel with you next summer.</em></li>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Suppose</strong2> </span>she doesn’t believe you, what would you do then?</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Inversion in conditional sentences</h2>
        <h4>Should you find</h4>
        <p>In <strong2>first conditional</strong2> sentences it’s possible to use <strong2>should</strong2> at the beginning of the sentence instead of <strong2>if</strong2>. This form is formal and it’s quite common with an imperative form in the main clause.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Should</strong2></span> you find the&nbsp;answer, please let me know as soon as possible.&nbsp;</em>(=If you find the answer)</li>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Should</strong2></span> you change your mind, you know where to contact us.&nbsp;</em>(=If you change your mind)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Had we arrived</h4>
        <p>In <strong2>third conditional</strong2> sentences, we can invert the auxiliary verb&nbsp;<strong2>had</strong2> and leave&nbsp;<strong2>if</strong2> out.&nbsp;<em>Had we arrived =&nbsp;</em>If we had arrived.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Had we arrived</strong2></span> earlier, we could have prevented the incident.&nbsp;</em></li>
        <li><em><strong2><span style="color: #ec6825;">Had they looked</span></strong2> further into the data, they might&nbsp;have realised there was a mistake.&nbsp;</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Were we to announce</h4>
        <p>We can also find cases of inversion with this structure: <strong2>were</strong2> + subject + <strong2>to.</strong2> + infinitive.&nbsp;It is used to talk about f<strong2>uture improbable events</strong2> (like the <strong2>second conditional</strong2>).</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em><strong2><span style="color: #ec6825;">Were we to announce</span></strong2> the truth, we would receive a lot of criticism.</em>&nbsp;(=<em>If we announced</em> …)</li>
        <li><em><strong2><span style="color: #ec6825;">Were they to buy</span></strong2> a new house, they would need to sell the old one first.&nbsp;</em>(=<em>If they bought</em> …)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Negative forms:&nbsp;<strong2>should I not, had we not, were we not</strong2></h4>
        <p>When <strong2>should</strong2>, <strong2>had</strong2> or <strong2>were</strong2> are&nbsp;negative, contracted forms are not possible, and &nbsp;<strong2>not</strong2> is used after the subject.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Should you not wish</strong2></span> to retake the test, you must let us know before the end of June</em>. (NOT <del>Shouldn’t you wish</del>)</li>
        <li><em><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong2>Had you not refused</strong2></span> my invitation, we would have had the most incredible time in our lives</em>. (NOT <del>Hadn’t you refused</del>)</li>
        <li><em><strong2><span style="color: #ec6825;">Were you not</span></strong2> my brother, I would call the police.&nbsp;</em>(NOT <del>Weren’t you</del>)</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Mixed conditionals</h2>
            <p>Mixed conditionals are a combination of two types of conditional patterns, usually <a href="https://test-english.com/grammar-points/b1-b2/second-third-conditionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second and third conditionals</a>. We can have a third conditional in the <strong>if</strong> clause and a second conditional in the main clause or a second conditional in the <strong>if</strong> clause and a third conditional in the main clause.</p>

            </center>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Second and third conditionals</h4>
            <p>In a second conditional we use past in the <strong>if</strong> clause and&nbsp;<strong>would/might/could + infinitive </strong>in the main clause. It is used to talk about hypothetical situations happening in the <strong>present or future</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>If I <strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">were</span></strong> rich, I<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>‘d buy</strong></span> that house.&nbsp;</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In a third conditional we use past perfect in the <strong>if</strong> clause and&nbsp;<strong>would/might/could + have + past participle </strong>in the main clause. It is used to talk about hypothetical situations happening in the <strong>past</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>If you <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>had studied</strong></span> more, you <strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">would have passed</span></strong> the exam.&nbsp;</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>A mixed conditional is a combination of second and third conditionals.<br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Mixed third/second conditional</h4>
            <p>We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the past (third conditional) with a present result (second conditional). We use past perfect in the&nbsp;<strong>if</strong> clause and&nbsp;<strong>would/could/might + infinitive</strong> in the main clause.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>had been elected</strong></span>, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would be</strong></span> the president now.&nbsp;</em></li>
            <li><em>If I<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong> had won</strong></span> the lottery, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would be</strong></span> rich.</em></li>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>might have</strong></span> a better job now if I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>hadn’t dropped</strong> </span>out of school.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Mixed second/third conditional</h4>
            <p>We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the present (second conditional) with a past result (third conditional). We use past in the <strong>if</strong> clause and&nbsp;<strong>would/could/might + have + past participle</strong> in the main clause.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>were</strong></span> a man, they <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would have given</strong></span> me the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></li>
            <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>didn’t have</strong></span> so much work, I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would have gone</strong></span> to the party last night.</em></li>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would have understood</strong></span> them if I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>spoke</strong></span> German.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Note</span> that in this type of combination, the present condition also existed in the past, when the result in the main clause took place. Let’s take a look, for example, at the first sentence:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>If I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>were</strong></span> a man, they <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would have given</strong></span> me the job.&nbsp;</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If I were a man now would mean that I would also have been a man in the past, when I was not given the job. As I’m not a man now (which implies that I wasn’t a man when I applied for the job either), I didn’t get the job.</p>
